The Gradle Wrapper Current Gradle version Adding a wrapper Upgrading the Gradle version Basic Setup Best Practises Why Gradle? Gradle is very comfortable task manager to build your project. You can define the required tasks with a short amount of code . The Gradle Wrapper The gradle wrapper helps you to install the Gradle version you need. Current Gradle version ./gradlew --version Adding a wrapper gradle wrapper Upgrading the Gradle version Define the version of Gradle you would like to have: ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 4.9 You can verify it like following: $ cat gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME distributionPath=wrapper/dists distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.9-bin.zip zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME zipStorePath=wrapper/dists Basic Setup Of course it requires apply plugin: 'groovy' because the shared library (Jenkins) depends on it. The source sets have to be changed because the Jenkins guys do not use the standard folder structure as proposed by Maven/Gradle. The name of the languages (here: groovy) has been removed from the paths. You are not advised to use vars in the source sets because you cannot test the code and you code coverage would essentially decrease. Jacoco is used as official documented. Here 1.0 is adjusted as code coverage limit means 100% code coverage is expected. Adding new functionality without adding sufficient tests will fail the build. Codenarc is the static code analyser for Groovy. Most rules are used and located under config/codenarc/codenarc.rules . Every rule that is not correct applied will fail the build. Coveralls (a great service for visualizing code coverage results) is useful if you run your Github project with integrations like Travis CI - In both cases you have to enable the repository there before you can use it; in my case login with my Github Account to Travis CI as well as to COVERALLS ; it's mainly a button to toggle the wanted repository on/off. Best Practises When one of your tests is failing Gradle usually prints the path to the XML file instead of showing the problem. Therefor you can do following: gradle test -i ; the -i forces to print all to stdout and that way you can easily scroll back the terminal to the printed callstack. Continous testing can be done with gradle test -it . Gradle detects changes in files when you save them and reruns the tasks (here: all tests). You also can run individual tests with a filter: gradle test -it --tests GradleTest","title":"How to organize Gradle"}]}
